#IOT PROJECT
The IR sensor sends signal through arduino for the RFID to scan the bar code.
When the car/bus crosses the toll pass a certain amount is cut from the balance and is displayed on the serial monitor.The RFID scans the bar code on the car/bus and performs the entire function . Once the entire amount is cut the servo motor opens the gate and then the gate is closed again for the next car.
